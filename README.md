# Console-Finances---Module-4-Challenge

## Creation of a console log that displays a company's profit and losses data.

My motivation for this project is to calculate the total months, total profit/loss, average changes in profit/loss and the greatest increase and decrease in profit/loss per month and display this information in the console log for people to view.

I would like a central location to view these calculations making it easier for the business to carry out financial analysis.

Having this information in the console log means that business executives can quickly and clearly see which months perform the best for their business.

During this project I was able to practice how to use Javascript loop to complete the different calculations that increased in difficulty.
